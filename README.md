Course work for OpenCampus: From LLMs to AI Agents

## [Session 1 Homework](https://opencampus.gitbook.io/opencampus-machine-learning-program/courses/from-llms-to-ai-agents/week-1-course-introduction#course-session)

Already have Ollama installed and accounts for Open AI, Claude, and ChatGPT.
Also got Python 3 and [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) on my Mac.

Got myself a dedicated OpenAI API key and HuggingFace access token for the course:

- [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys), check billing to make sure you have enough credits. Also set usage limits to avoid unexpected charges.
- HuggingFace API Key/Access Token: [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)

Installed the recommended model:

```bash
ollama run gemma3:1b
```

Used the Anaconda Jupyter Lab to run the ['first steps' notebook](https://github.com/WikiMind-GmbH/knowledge-base/blob/main/llms/first-steps/first-steps.ipynb).
