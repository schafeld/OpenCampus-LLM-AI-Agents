The question asks: \\n\\n**\"Which number yields the same result when it is added or multiplied with itself?\"**\\n\\nAt first glance, this seems straightforward, but let\\'s break it down to ensure we understand it correctly and arrive at the right answer.\\n\\n### Understanding the Problem\\n\\nWe\\'re looking for a number (let\\'s call it **x**) such that:\\n\\n- When you **add** the number to itself: x + x\\n- When you **multiply** the number by itself: x * x\\n\\nBoth operations yield the **same result**. In other words:\\n\\nx + x = x * x\\n\\n### Translating to an Equation\\n\\nLet\\'s write this as an equation:\\n\\nx + x = x * x\\n\\nSimplifying the left side:\\n\\n2x = xÂ²\\n\\nNow, we have a simple equation to solve for x:\\n\\nxÂ² = 2x\\n\\n### Solving the Equation\\n\\nTo solve for x, let\\'s rearrange the equation:\\n\\nxÂ² - 2x = 0\\n\\nThis is a quadratic equation. We can factor it:\\n\\nx(x - 2) = 0\\n\\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives us the possible solutions:\\n\\n1. x = 0\\n2. x - 2 = 0 â†’ x = 2\\n\\nSo, the potential solutions are x = 0 and x = 2.\\n\\n### Verifying the Solutions\\n\\nIt\\'s always good practice to verify our solutions by plugging them back into the original conditions.\\n\\n**First Solution: x = 0**\\n\\n- Addition: 0 + 0 = 0\\n- Multiplication: 0 * 0 = 0\\n- Are they equal? Yes, 0 = 0.\\n\\n**Second Solution: x = 2**\\n\\n- Addition: 2 + 2 = 4\\n- Multiplication: 2 * 2 = 4\\n- Are they equal? Yes, 4 = 4.\\n\\nBoth x = 0 and x = 2 satisfy the original condition.\\n\\n### Considering the Question\\'s Context\\n\\nNow, the question asks for \"which number,\" which might imply a singular answer. However, mathematically, both 0 and 2 satisfy the given condition. \\n\\nBut let\\'s think about the phrasing: \"added or multiplied with itself.\" \\n\\n- For x = 0:\\n  - Adding: 0 + 0 = 0\\n  - Multiplying: 0 * 0 = 0\\n  - Both operations yield 0.\\n\\n- For x = 2:\\n  - Adding: 2 + 2 = 4\\n  - Multiplying: 2 * 2 = 4\\n  - Both operations yield 4.\\n\\nBoth numbers satisfy the condition where adding the number to itself gives the same result as multiplying the number by itself.\\n\\nHowever, if we consider that multiplying a number by itself is the same as adding it to itself, both 0 and 2 are valid. But often, such puzzles are looking for a non-trivial answer (i.e., not zero), so 2 might be the intended answer.\\n\\nBut mathematically, both are correct unless specified otherwise.\\n\\n### Exploring Further\\n\\nIs there any other number that satisfies this condition?
