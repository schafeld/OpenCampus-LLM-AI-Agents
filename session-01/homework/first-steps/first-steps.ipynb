In other words:\\n\\n**x + x = x * x**\\n\\n### Translating to an Equation\\n\\nLet\\'s write this as an equation:\\n\\nx + x = x * x\\n\\nSimplifying the left side:\\n\\n2x = x²\\n\\nNow, we have a simple quadratic equation:\\n\\nx² = 2x\\n\\n### Solving the Equation\\n\\nTo solve for x, let\\'s rearrange the equation:\\n\\nx² - 2x = 0\\n\\nThis can be factored as:\\n\\nx(x - 2) = 0\\n\\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:\\n\\n1. x = 0\\n2. x - 2 = 0 ⇒ x = 2\\n\\nSo, the possible solutions are x = 0 and x = 2.\\n\\n### Verifying the Solutions\\n\\nIt\\'s always good practice to verify our solutions by plugging them back into the original conditions.\\n\\n**First Solution: x = 0**\\n\\n- Addition: 0 + 0 = 0\\n- Multiplication: 0 * 0 = 0\\n- Comparison: 0 = 0 ✔️\\n\\n**Second Solution: x = 2**\\n\\n- Addition: 2 + 2 = 4\\n- Multiplication: 2 * 2 = 4\\n- Comparison: 4 = 4 ✔️\\n\\nBoth 0 and 2 satisfy the original condition.\\n\\n### Considering the Context\\n\\nNow, the question asks for \"which number,\" which might imply a single answer.

    "\n",
    "In API requests, the term payload refers to the **actual data** or information being sent within the request, typically in the body of an HTTP request (such as POST or PUT). The term is derived from communication and networking protocols, where the payload is the part of transmitted data that contains the meaningful information, as opposed to headers or metadata which describe or route the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is the term \"payload\" commonly used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Historical Origin:\n",
    "The term originally comes from aerospace and transport, describing the **actual useful content** carried by a vehicle (like cargo in a truck or spacecraft).\n",
    "\n",
    "Clear Differentiation:\n",
    "It clearly distinguishes between control data (headers, parameters, routing information) and the actual content (payload) intended for processing by the receiving application or service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generalization:\n",
    "Payload provides a generic, neutral term for the transmitted data, regardless of its structure (JSON, XML, plain text, binary files, etc.), which simplifies communication across different APIs and systems."
